# Image_Recognition-DL
This repository is dedicated to recognizing images using a model built with Keras, convolutional layers (Conv2D), max-pooling layers (MaxPool2D), flattening layers (Flatten), and dense layers. The model is trained using an Image Data Generator with various hyperparameters to achieve accurate image recognition.
